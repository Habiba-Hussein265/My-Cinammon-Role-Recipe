        <ol style="border: 2px solid;">
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, yeast, cinnamon, cumin, and salt.</li>
            <li>Add the warm water, melted butter, and mix until a dough forms.</li>
            <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 10 minutes, until smooth.</li>
            <li>Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise for about 1 hour, or until doubled in size.</li>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
            <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to become thick.</li>
            <li>Brush the dough with melted butter, then sprinkle the cinnamon sugar evenly over the top.</li>
            <li>Using a sharp knife or a thread, cut the dough into equal strips.</li>
            <li>Roll each strip into a tight cylinder and place them seam-side down on a greased baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until golden brown.</li>
            <li>While the rolls are baking, prepare the glaze by whisking together 1 cup of powdered sugar and 2 tablespoons of milk in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Once the rolls are done, let them cool for a few minutes before drizzling the glaze over the top.</li>
            <li>Serve with some tea or coffee or you can have it as a snack too.</li>
